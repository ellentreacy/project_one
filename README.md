# St. Annes Park 

This project designs a modern website for St. Annes Park in North Dublin, which previously did not have a website or any centralised information on events. In compiling information related to the park, this website hopes to encourage both current park users and new users to join the community events that happen at the park. As the world begins to open up again, it is of utmost importance that we come together and socialise, ensuring that the community is healthy and happy. 

As a current user of the park, and as someone looking to meet new people and socialise following the lonley period of time that was the pandemic, I found it difficult to find information on what groups were on in the park, and how to join them. Currently, information is dissemited via FaceBook and other social media, and word of mouth. By making information readily available, more people will be able to join the activities.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- Header
  - Logo
    - The Logo is on all three pages. It is repsonsive. The logo acts as a link back to the home page, rather than creating another link in the navigation bar - this feels more intuitive. 
  - Navigation Bar
    - The Navigation Bar has links to the Community and Events page, and the Newsletter sign up page.
