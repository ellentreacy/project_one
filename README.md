#St. Annes Park 

This project designs a modern website for St. Annes Park in North Dublin, which previously did not have a website or any centralised information on events. In compiling information related to the park, this website hopes to encourage both current park users and new users to join the community events that happen at the park. As the world begins to open up again, it is of utmost importance that we come together and socialise, ensuring that the community is healthy and happy.
